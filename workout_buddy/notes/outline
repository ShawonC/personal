Project Goal = Finished product will randomly generate a weekly workout scheudle

			   			- Order of exercises (not repeating muscles on the same days)
			   			- 
					- What type of week the user is working
						- strength building
						- muscle building
						- endurance
						- pilates
						- hiit (high intesitiy interval training)
						- cardio
						- sport
						- stretching (always part of the routine)
						- recovery
					- Goals the user has
						- Gaining Muscle Mass (weight scales towards muscle buidling)
						- Gaining Endurance (weight scales towards endurance and hiit)
						- Flexibility (weight scales towards pilates)
						- 
					-  
			   Will email workout plan to user.

User Input Module
	
	Queries:
	- Height (metric or imperial)
	- Weight (lbs)
		- Ask to store on first run and save answers to local yaml file
	- Type of workout week desired (can mix types, specify splits)


	Structure:

	first install: class variables set to none, write input from script into yaml file for later use, turn on updating of exercises automatically

	second install: run overall conditional to evaluate if class variables are set, ask user if they want to change any existing variables, check for automatic exercise updates(if off ask if want to update. Offer to turn off prompt)

Yaml to JSON Exercise Job
	
	- Queries websites for JSON response using requests and saves it to a file.
	- CRON or other job runs in folder to do a new pull weekly
		- Dumps JSON information into yaml file
